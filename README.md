# Quantum-Oracle

This is the side project of the quantum algorithm, the source comes from the course -> CE3005 - Algorithmics.

What we wnat to do in this project is judging the black box function whether balanced or constant; therefore, there are four possibilities.

* ### Constant: Output equal 0. 
* ### Constant: Output equal 1. 
* ### Balanced: Input equal Output. 
* ### Balanced: Input not equal Output.
